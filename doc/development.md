# Developer Documentation

This documentation provides a basic understanding of reading and debugging the source code of the OAuth package related to `"mcp[cli]"`. It is based on [the example from the official page](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/python-sdk/tree/main/examples), to which time has been dedicated to comprehend both its own flow and the flow of the source code it uses. From this foundation, the experience of reading and understanding the OAuth flow of the source code and example is shared.

> ### ⚠️ WARNING
